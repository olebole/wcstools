<H3>WCSTools 3.1.1 (June 26, 2002)</H3>

WCSTools is a set of software utilities, written in C, which create,
display and manipulate the world coordinate system of a FITS or IRAF
image, using specific keywords in the image header which relate pixel
position within the image to position on the sky.  Auxillary programs
search star catalogs and manipulate images.

The WCSTools package was developed by Doug Mink at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, with significant code from
<UL>
<LI>Bill Cotton of NRAO (projection),
<LI>Mark Calabretta of CSIRO (projection),
<LI>Pat Wallace of Cambridge University (coordinate conversion), and
<LI>Elwood Downey of the University of Iowa (WCS fitting procedure).

<LI>Bill Joye and Eric Mandel of SAO, Allan Brighton of ESO, and
Jean-Baptiste Marquette of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris helped
debug the subroutine library.
<LI>Norman Grogin, Scott Kenyon, and Susan
Tokarz of SAO and Andreas Jaunsen helped debug the programs.

To install the code, create a directory for it, download it, and run
<PRE>
        gzcat wcstools-3.1.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
or
        unzip wcstls31.zip
</PRE>

The main directory will contain the source code for the programs, and
a subdirectory, libwcs, will contain the source code for the subroutines
Catalog access subroutines, such as gscread.c, uacread.c, and ujcread.c,
contain wired-in paths to the root directories of the HST Guide Star Catalog,
the USNO A 2.0 Catalog, and the USNO J Catalog, respectively.  You
should change them to match the path in your local installation.
Environment variables may be also used to override whatever path is
in the code:  GSC_NORTH sets the path for the HST GSC CDROM containing
the northern hemisphere and GSC_SOUTH does the same for the southern
hemisphere.
