Version 2.2 (May 14, 1998)
Compute pixels from galactic coordinates correctly.
Implement arbitrary equinox in form Jyyyy.ffff or Byyyy.ffff.
Modify polynomial WCS to be closer to what is being discussed in fitswcs.
Add support for ecliptic coordinates, and improve coordinate conversion.
Fix pixel to WCS IRAF TNX projection; WCS to pixel still has problems.
Add support for IRAF unsigned data types

Version 2.1 (March 31, 1998)
Add polynomial plate fit and IRAF TNX projection.  Fix various bugs.
Fit CD matrix as well as CDELT/CROTA.
Add iteration and recentering to IMWCS.

Version 2.0 (February 18, 1998)
Use Mark Calabretta's WCS code instead of AIPS classic WCS subroutines
for the standard FITS projections.

Version 1.5 (December 15, 1997)
Rewrite IRAF code to deal with IRAF 2.11 reformatted headers.  Fix a variety
bugs.  Switch to single catalog search and image-based catalog search programs,
invoked by different names for different catalogs.

Version 1.4 (October 16, 1997)
Rewrite FITS code to deal with FITS image extensions.  Fix bugs in fitting
routine and deal with off-axis images, such as those from CCD mosaics.

Version 1.3.1 (April 25, 1997)
Fixed major bug in USNO A-1.0 and USNO SA-1.0 catalog reading which ignored
stars which are flagged as being in the Guide Star Catalog

Version 1.3 (February 24, 1997)
Fixed pointer tests to check for NULL rather than 0 so they will work
properly in Linux.  Coordinate conversion inconsistencies were repaired.
All programs which only use header information call a common subroutine
to read the header.

Version 1.2.2 (January 27, 1997):
Fixed bug in HGET which ignored exponent of floating point string when
extracting an integer due to use of atoi() instead of (int)atof().
This most often affects how EPOCH is interpreted.

Version 1.2.1 (January 15, 1997):
Fixed bug in RA sorting which affected all catalog search programs
