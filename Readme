WCSTools

This is version 2.2 of the WCSTools package developed at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory.  It is a set of software utilities, written
in C, which create, display and manipulate the world coordinate system
of a FITS or IRAF image, using specific keywords in the image header
which relate pixel position within the image to position on the sky.
Auxillary programs search star catalogs and manipulate images.  
Documentation, with examples, is on the World Wide Web at

Brief descriptions of file contents are in the Programs file and a history
of this software is in the Versions file
