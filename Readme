WCSTools 3.9.7

WCSTools is a set of software utilities, written in C, which create,
display and manipulate the world coordinate system of a FITS or IRAF
image, using specific keywords in the image header which relate pixel
position within the image to position on the sky.  Auxillary programs
search star catalogs and manipulate images.

This is version 3.9.7 of the WCSTools package developed by Jessica Mink
(jmink@cfa.harvard.edu) at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
with significant code or algorithms from

Mark Calabretta of CSIRO (projection),
Bill Cotton of NRAO (projection),
Jesse Doggett and Rick White of StScI (DSS projection)
Elwood Downey of the University of Iowa (WCS fitting procedure),
John Roll of SAO (network access),
Jing Li of IPAC (SIP distortion),
Pat Wallace of Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK (coordinate conversion),
Frank Valdes of NOAO (support for NOAO's ZPX projection), and
Ed Los of HCO (support for Emmanuel Bertin's SCAMP distortion correction).

Bill Joye and Eric Mandel of SAO, Allan Brighton of ESO, and Jean-Baptiste
Marquette of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, and David Shupe of IPAC
helped debug the subroutine library.
Norman Grogin, Scott Kenyon, Susan Tokarz, Dan Koranyi, Guillermo Torres,
Steve Willner, Gus Muensch, Ed Los and others of the CfA and Andreas Jaunsen
helped debug the astrometry programs.
Sergio Pascual of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid helped me get
all of the variables initialized.

To assist users in selecting the best catalog to use, we tested the accuracy of
the various catalogs one is likely to use with imwcs, showing how well it works
in a pipeline mode on 1728 images. This ADASS paper is an improved version of
our AAS/DDA paper, adding the UCAC2 catalog and emphasizing usefulness more than
astrometry:
