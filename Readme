WCSTools

WCSTools is a set of software utilities, written in C, which create,
display and manipulate the world coordinate system of a FITS or IRAF
image, using specific keywords in the image header which relate pixel
position within the image to position on the sky.  Auxillary programs
search star catalogs and manipulate images.

This is version 2.6.3 of the WCSTools package developed by Doug Mink
(dmink@cfa.harvard.edu) at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
with significant code from

Bill Cotton of NRAO (projection),
Mark Calabretta of CSIRO (projection),
Pat Wallace of Cambridge University (coordinate conversion), and
Elwood Downey of the University of Iowa (WCS fitting procedure).

Bill Joye and Eric Mandel of SAO and Allan Brighton of ESO helped
debug the subroutine library.  Norm Grogan, Scott Kenyon, Susan
Tokarz, and Dan Koranyi of SAO and Andreas Jaunsen helped debug
the astrometry programs.

Details of updates are in the Versions file.

Brief descriptions of the programs follow:

addpix	Add a constant value(s) to specified pixel(s)

conpix	Operate on all of the pixels of an image

delhead	Delete specified keywords from FITS or IRAF image file headers

delwcs	Delete the WCS keywords from an image. If both EPOCH and EQUINOX
	are present, EQUINOX is also deleted. 

edhead	Edit the header of a FITS file or the user parameters of an IRAF
	image file using a the text editor specified by the EDITOR environment
	variable.

gethead	Return values for keyword(s) specified after filename.

getpix	Return value(s) of specified pixel(s)

gettab	Extract values from tab table data base files

i2f	Read two-dimensional IRAF image file and write FITS image file

imcat	List catalog sources which should be found in the area of the sky
	covered by a specific image.  Special catalogs supported include
	the HST Guide Star Catalog, the USNO A 1.0 Catalog, the SAO Catalog,
	and the PPM Catalog.

imextract Extract 1- or 2-dimensional images from 2- or 3-dimensional images

imhead	Print FITS or IRAF header

immatch	Match catalog and image stars using the WCS in the image file.

imrot	Rotate and/or reflect FITS or IRAF image files

imsize	Print center and size of image using WCS keywords in header

imstack	Stack 1-dimensional images into a 2-dimensional image

imstar	Find and list the n brightest stars in an IRAF or FITS image, with
	their sky coordinates if there is WCS information in the image header. 

imwcs	Automaticaly find stars in a FITS or IRAF image, match them to HST
	Guide or UJC Stars, compute the relation between sky coordinates and
	image coordinates, and write in in the image header.

keyhead	Change keyword names in headers of FITS or IRAF images.

newhead	Create dataless FITS image header files with BITPIX=0

sethead	Set header keyword values in FITS or IRAF images.

setpix	Set specified pixel(s) to specified value(s)

scat	Search a source catalog given a region on the sky.  Special catalogs
	supported include the HST Guide Star Catalog, the USNO A and ACT
	Catalogs, the SAO Catalog, and the PPM Catalog.

sky2xy	Print image pixel coordinates for given sky coordinates on the
	command line or in a list file. 

skycoor	Convert between J2000, B1950, and Galactic coordinates from the
	command line or a file.

sumpix	Total pixel values over an image row or column or a specified area

wcshead	Print basic world coordinate system information on one line per image

xy2sky	Print sky coordinates for given image pixel coordinates on the command
	line or in a list file.
